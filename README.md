- **Database**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used for flexible data storage.
- **Authentication**: Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication and bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Payment Integration**: Payments are processed via Razorpay.
- **Media Management**: Media files (images, videos, documents) are stored and managed using Cloudinary.
